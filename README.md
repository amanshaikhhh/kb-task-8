Simple Rule-Based Chatbot (Python CLI Project)
Project Overview
This Python project is a command-line chatbot that interacts with users using simple rules and keywords. The bot can respond to greetings, FAQs, and common questions based on predefined logic, giving users instant replies through a clean console interface.

The project focuses on mastering conditional statements, string processing, loops, and basic CLI interaction for artificial intelligence fundamentals.

Features
Responds to greetings like “hi” or “hello”

Answers basic FAQs (e.g., “What is your name?”, “How are you?”)

Uses simple if-elif-else logic and string matching for responses

Gracefully ends the conversation when the user types “bye”

Easy to extend additional rules or responses

How to Run
Make sure Python is installed.

Save the script as chatbot.py.

Open a terminal, navigate to the script’s folder, and run:

text
python chatbot.py
Chat with the bot interactively by typing your questions!

Example Usage
